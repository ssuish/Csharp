 /* OOP I - Basics of Object Oriented Programming in C#

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications and computer programs.

    The basics programming concepts in OOP
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance

    Abstraction - simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.

    Polymorphism - is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input.

    Encapsulation - hides the implementation details of a class from other objects.

    Inheritance - is a way to form new classes that already been defined.

/* Objects

    Objects are the building blocks of the OOP program.
    Object is a combination of data and methods. 
    The data and methods are called 'members' of an object.
    Objects communicate together through methods. 
    Each object can receive messages, send messages and process data.

*/

/* Classes

    Class is a template for object.
    It is a blueprint which describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class can share. 

    A class can be used to create many objects. 

    Objects are created at runtime from classes are called 'instances' of that particular class.
